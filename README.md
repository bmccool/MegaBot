### What is this repository for? ###

MegaBot is a program that will learn to play simple video games.  MegaBot is designed to run on an ubuntu desktop envrionment and play games through an emulator.  The goal of this project is for MegaBot to "learn" to play a game from only a video feed of the game as it's playing.  MegaBot will use OpenCV to pull frames from the emulator and interpret the frames so as to decide the best course of action for completing the game.
